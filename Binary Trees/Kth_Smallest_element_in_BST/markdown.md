## Kth Smallest Element in BST ‚Äî Approaches Explained

### Problem Statement
Given the `root` of a Binary Search Tree (BST) and an integer `k`, return the kth smallest value (1-indexed) among all the values of the nodes in the tree.

### üìò Example

#### Input
```text
BST Elements: 5, 3, 8, 2, 4, 7, 9
k = 3
Output: 4
```

#### Visual Diagram
```text
         5
        / \
       3   8
      / \ / \
     2 4 7  9
```
**Sorted order**: [2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9]  
**3rd smallest element**: 4

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Brute Force Approach (Preorder + Sorting)

#### Idea
- Perform preorder traversal of the BST and store all node values in an array.
- Sort the array to get elements in ascending order.
- Return the element at index `k-1`.

#### Why Brute Force?
- Uses preorder traversal (doesn't leverage BST property)
- Requires additional sorting step
- Processes all nodes even when we only need the kth smallest

#### Complexity
- Time: O(n log n) (due to sorting)
- Space: O(n) (storing all values)

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Better Approach (Inorder Traversal + Array)

#### Idea
- Perform inorder traversal of the BST to get values in sorted order.
- Store all values in an array.
- Return the element at index `k-1`.

#### Advantage
- Leverages BST property (inorder gives sorted sequence)
- No sorting needed since inorder traversal of BST gives sorted order
- Cleaner and more intuitive approach

#### Complexity
- Time: O(n) (single traversal)
- Space: O(n) (storing all values)

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Optimal Approach (Modified Inorder with Early Termination)

#### Idea
- Use modified inorder traversal with a counter.
- Instead of storing all values, count nodes as we visit them.
- When counter reaches `k`, we've found our answer.
- Return immediately without processing remaining nodes.

#### Why Optimal?
- **Space Efficient**: O(h) space complexity where h is height of tree
- **Early Termination**: Stops as soon as kth element is found
- **No Extra Storage**: Doesn't store all node values
- **Leverages BST Property**: Uses inorder traversal for sorted access

#### Complexity
- Time: O(k) in best case, O(n) in worst case
- Space: O(h) for recursion stack (h = height of tree)

### üìä Comparison Summary

| Approach | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Pros | Cons |
|----------|----------------|------------------|------|------|
| **Brute Force** | O(n log n) | O(n) | Simple to understand | Inefficient sorting step |
| **Better** | O(n) | O(n) | Leverages BST property | Stores all values unnecessarily |
| **Optimal** | O(k) to O(n) | O(h) | Space efficient, early exit | Slightly more complex logic |
