✅ DSA Question: Tower of Hanoi
🧠 Problem

Given three rods and n disks of different sizes, the objective is to move all the disks from the source rod to the destination rod, using the auxiliary rod, following these constraints:

Only one disk may be moved at a time.

Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack.

No larger disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

Example:
For n = 3, the steps to move disks from Rod A to Rod C using Rod B would follow the recursive pattern:

Move 2 disks to auxiliary

Move bottom disk to destination

Move 2 disks from auxiliary to destination

🧭 Approach

If there's only one disk, move it directly from source to destination.

Otherwise:

Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary rod.

Move the remaining disk to destination rod.

Move the n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination rod.

🔁 Generic Logic (Pseudocode)

function towerOfHanoi(n, source, destination, auxiliary):
    if n == 1:
        print "Move disk 1 from", source, "to", destination
        return

    towerOfHanoi(n - 1, source, auxiliary, destination)
    print "Move disk", n, "from", source, "to", destination
    towerOfHanoi(n - 1, auxiliary, destination, source)

⏱️ Complexities

Time Complexity
O(2ⁿ - 1) — Exponential; each call spawns two more for n-1 disks.

Space Complexity
O(n) — Recursion stack depth is proportional to number of disks.
