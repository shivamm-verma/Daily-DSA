## ✅ DSA Question: Merge Sort

---

### 🧠 Problem  

Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that splits an array into halves, recursively sorts them, and merges the sorted halves into a single sorted array.

---

## 🧭 Approach

1. Divide the array into two halves.  
2. Recursively apply Merge Sort on both halves until each subarray has one element.  
3. Merge the two sorted halves into a single sorted array.  
4. Repeat until the entire array is sorted.  

**Properties:**  
- Stable: equal elements retain their relative order.  
- Not in-place: requires extra memory for merging.

## 🔁 Generic Logic (Pseudocode)
```text
function mergeSort(arr):
    if length(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    mid = length(arr) / 2
    left = mergeSort(arr[0:mid])
    right = mergeSort(arr[mid:])
    return merge(left, right)

function merge(left, right):
    result = []
    while left and right:
        if left[0] <= right[0]:
            result.append(left.pop(0))
        else:
            result.append(right.pop(0))
    return result + left + right
```

## ⏱️ Complexities
 > Time Complexity


* Best case: **O(n log n)**
* Average case: **O(n log n)**
* Worst case: **O(n log n)**


> Space Complexity
* **O(n)** (extra memory for merging)
