# 🧮 Three Sum Closest

## 📘 Problem Statement

Given an array `nums` of `n` integers and an integer `target`, find three integers in `nums` such that the sum is closest to `target`. Return the sum of the three integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

## 🧠 Pseudo Code

```python
function threeSumClosest(nums, target):
    sort nums
    initialize res as infinity

    for i from 0 to length(nums) - 2:
        j = i + 1
        k = length(nums) - 1

        while j < k:
            total = nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k]

            if abs(total - target) < abs(res - target):
                res = total

            if total > target:
                k -= 1
            else if total < target:
                j += 1
            else:
                return res

    return res
```

## 📊 Example

### Input:
nums = [-1, 2, 1, -4]
target = 1

### Output:
2

---

## Explanation:

The possible triplets are:

(-1, 2, 1) → sum = 2
(-1, 2, -4) → sum = -3
(-1, 1, -4) → sum = -4
(2, 1, -4) → sum = -1

The closest sum to target 1 is 2.

## 🧩 Explanation

- First, sort the array to enable two-pointer traversal.
- Fix one element and use two pointers (j and k) to find the best pair that, along with the fixed element, gives the closest sum.
- Update the result whenever a closer sum is found.
- If the exact target is found, return immediately.

## ⏱️ Time Complexity

𝑂(𝑛log⁡𝑛) for Sorting
𝑂(𝑛^2) for Two-pointer traversal 

Overall: 
𝑂(𝑛^2)

## 🧠 Space Complexity

Auxiliary space: 
𝑂(1)
Sorting is done in-place and no extra space is used beyond variables.
