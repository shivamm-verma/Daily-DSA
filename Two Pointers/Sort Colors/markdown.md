# 🎨 Sort Colors Problem

## 📘 Problem Statement
Given an array nums containing only integers 0, 1, and 2, sort the array in-place so that:
All 0s come first,
Followed by all 1s,
Then all 2s.
You cannot use the library sort function. The goal is to rearrange elements efficiently without extra space.

## 🧠 Approach
- Use the Dutch National Flag algorithm with three pointers:
```
low → boundary for 0s
mid → current element
high → boundary for 2s
```

- Traverse the array while mid <= high:
```
If nums[mid] == 0: swap with nums[low], increment low and mid.
If nums[mid] == 1: move mid forward.
If nums[mid] == 2: swap with nums[high], decrement high.
```

This ensures all 0s are at the start, 2s at the end, and 1s remain in the middle.
This method sorts the array in one pass without extra space.

## 📊 Example

Input:
nums = `[2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0]`

Output: `[0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]`

### Explanation:
0s are moved to the start,
1s are in the middle,
2s are moved to the end.

## ⏱️ Time Complexity
Single-pass traversal: O(n)

Overall: O(n)

## 🧮 Space Complexity
In-place: O(1)

No extra arrays are used; only a few pointers.
