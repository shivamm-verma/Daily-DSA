# Longest Palindromic Substring ‚Äî Approaches Explained

## Problem Statement
Given a string `s`, return the **longest palindromic substring** in `s`. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward.

## üìò Example

#### Input
```text
s = "babad"
Output: "bab" (or "aba")
```

#### Visual Explanation
```text
String: b a b a d
        ‚Üë   ‚Üë   
       "bab" is palindrome (length 3)
       
String: b a b a d
          ‚Üë ‚Üë ‚Üë
         "aba" is palindrome (length 3)
```

#### More Examples
```text
Input: s = "cbbd"
Output: "bb"

Input: s = "racecar" 
Output: "racecar"
```

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Brute Force Approach

### Idea
- Generate all possible substrings of the input string
- Check each substring to see if it's a palindrome
- Keep track of the longest palindrome found

### Why Brute Force?
- Checks every possible substring (n¬≤ substrings)
- For each substring, performs palindrome check (O(n) operation)
- No optimization or early termination
- Doesn't leverage any string properties

### Algorithm Steps
1. Use nested loops to generate all substrings
2. For each substring, check if it's a palindrome by comparing characters from both ends
3. Update the longest palindrome if current substring is longer

### Complexity
- **Time**: O(n¬≥) - O(n¬≤) substrings √ó O(n) palindrome check
- **Space**: O(1) - Only storing result string

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Better Approach (Expand Around Centers)

### Idea
- For each possible center in the string, expand outward while characters match
- Handle both odd-length palindromes (single center) and even-length palindromes (center between two characters)
- Keep track of the longest palindrome found during expansion

### Advantage
- **Eliminates redundant checks**: Instead of checking all substrings, only expands promising centers
- **Leverages palindrome property**: Uses the fact that palindromes are symmetric around their center
- **Early termination**: Stops expanding when characters don't match
- **Handles both cases**: Efficiently manages odd and even length palindromes

### Algorithm Steps
1. For each position `i` in the string:
   - Expand around center `i` (odd-length palindromes)
   - Expand around centers `i` and `i+1` (even-length palindromes)
2. For each expansion, continue while characters match
3. Update longest palindrome if current expansion is longer

### Complexity
- **Time**: O(n¬≤) - O(n) centers √ó O(n) expansion per center
- **Space**: O(1) - Only storing result string

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Optimal Approach (Manacher's Algorithm)

### Idea
- Transform the string to handle odd/even cases uniformly
- Use previously computed palindrome information to avoid redundant expansions
- Maintain the rightmost palindrome boundary and use symmetry property
- Achieve linear time complexity through clever optimizations

### Why Optimal?
- **Avoids redundant work**: Uses mirror property to skip known palindrome checks
- **Linear time complexity**: Each character is processed at most twice
- **Uniform handling**: Transforms string to treat odd/even palindromes consistently
- **Advanced technique**: Represents the theoretical optimal solution

### Algorithm Steps
1. **Transform string**: Insert separators (e.g., "abc" ‚Üí "^#a#b#c#$")
2. **Initialize arrays**: Track palindrome radius for each position
3. **Process each position**:
   - Use mirror property if within known palindrome boundary
   - Expand around center to find actual palindrome length
   - Update rightmost boundary if current palindrome extends further
4. **Find maximum**: Identify the longest palindrome from computed radii

### Key Concepts
- **P[i]**: Radius of palindrome centered at position i
- **Center & Right**: Track center and right boundary of rightmost palindrome
- **Mirror property**: P[i] ‚â• min(P[mirror], right - i) when i < right

### Complexity
- **Time**: O(n) - Each position expanded at most once
- **Space**: O(n) - Additional arrays for transformation and palindrome radii
