## Рюѓ№ИЈ Rod Cutting Problem Рђћ Approaches Explained

---

## ­ЪЊў Problem Statement

You are given a rod of length `n` and an array `price[]` of size `n` where `price[i]` denotes the price of a rod of length `i+1`.

Your task is to determine the **maximum total price obtainable** by cutting the rod and selling the pieces in such a way that the total length of the pieces is `n`.

**Note:** You can cut the rod into as many pieces as you want, and you can use the same piece length multiple times.

## ­ЪДф Example

### Input:
Price: [1, 5, 8, 9, 10, 17, 17, 20]        Maximum Obtainable Price: 22


### Explanation:
- Cut the rod into lengths 2 and 6.  
- Price = 5 (for length 2) + 17 (for length 6) = **22**

---

## ­ЪДа Relation to Unbounded Knapsack

- Each rod length is like an item.
- We can choose an item (length) multiple times Рєњ **unbounded**.
- `wt[i] = i+1`, `val[i] = price[i]`

## 1№ИЈРЃБ Brute Force Recursive Approach (Without Memoization)

### ­ЪњА Idea
- At every index:
  - **Take** the piece (stay at same index since unlimited cuts allowed).
  - **Not take** the piece (move to previous index).
- Base case: only one piece length left Рєњ take as many as possible if it fits.

### РџЎ№ИЈ Complexity
> ­ЪЋњ Time: O(2^n)  
> ­ЪДа Space: O(n) (recursion stack)

---

## 2№ИЈРЃБ Top-Down DP (Memoization)

### ­ЪњА Idea
- Store solutions to subproblems in a 2D `dp[ind][len]` table.
- Prevents recomputation of overlapping subproblems.

### РџЎ№ИЈ Complexity
> ­ЪЋњ Time: O(n ├Ќ n)  
> ­ЪДа Space: O(n ├Ќ n) (DP + stack space)

---

## 3№ИЈРЃБ Bottom-Up DP (Tabulation)

### ­ЪњА Idea
- Use a 2D table `dp[i][length]` where each cell stores the maximum price.
- Build from base case (only using first rod length).

### РџЎ№ИЈ Complexity
> ­ЪЋњ Time: O(n ├Ќ n)  
> ­ЪДа Space: O(n ├Ќ n)

---

## 4№ИЈРЃБ Space Optimized DP (1D Array)

### ­ЪњА Idea
- Instead of 2D table, use a 1D `dp[length]`.
- Update current state using previous results (same row update allowed in unbounded case).

### РџЎ№ИЈ Complexity
> ­ЪЋњ Time: O(n ├Ќ n)  
> ­ЪДа Space: O(n)
